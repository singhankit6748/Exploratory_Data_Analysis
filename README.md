# Exploratory Data Analysis 

It’s the process of exploring, summarizing, and visualizing a dataset to understand its key characteristics before applying more advanced modeling or statistical techniques.

# Purpose of EDA

To understand the structure of the data

To detect patterns, trends, and relationships

To identify anomalies or outliers

To check assumptions for statistical models

To guide further analysis or feature engineering

# Common Steps in EDA

Data Collection & Loading – Import data from sources like CSV, databases, or APIs.

Data Inspection – View dimensions, data types, and sample rows (head() in pandas).

Data Cleaning – Handle missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types.

Descriptive Statistics – Compute measures like mean, median, standard deviation.

Data Visualization – Use plots like histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and heatmaps.

Correlation & Relationship Analysis – Check how variables relate to each other.

Outlier Detection – Identify data points that deviate significantly from the rest.

# Tools & Libraries for EDA

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

R: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyverse

To identify anomalies or outliers

To check assumptions for statistical models

To guide further analysis or feature engineering
